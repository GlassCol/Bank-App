# Bank_Demo_App

This application is being made with the intentions of practicing with React js and Spring Security.
The application is meant to allow a user to login and use a website in order to fullfill transaction between accounts

#Design
This is a react app using a java spring boot api to connect to a database of the user's choice

# Installation

Simply installing and running the front and back end will function but you will want to have your own database set up
on port 8080 name bankdemo as well as setting the configuration file in the API to your local settings i.e. your
username and password for your database

# Status

This project is still being developed and should be done shortly
